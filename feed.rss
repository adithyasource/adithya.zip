    <p>
      so for my most recent design and development projects, i have been using
      two tools that i have come to deeply adore:
      <a href="https://www.piratepx.com/" target="_blank">piratepx</a> and
      <a href="https://counter.dev/" target="_blank">counter.dev</a> </p> <p>
      these two tools, for me (with very small and simple projects to put out)
      at least, these analytics tracking tools are perfect. they do not use much
      of the users bandwidth or compute time trying to download a bunch of
      tracking javascript or adding cookies to the browser. </p> <p>
      due to both being highly privacy focused, they dont have the need to
      create cookies, fingerprint ip addresses, log extensive user data, etc.
      counter.dev costs the user about 730 bytes whereas piratepx asks for only
      37 bytes.
      </p> <p>
      piratepx can be sooo lightweight since it only ships a 1x1 pixel .gif file
      to the user which then counts as a pageview. counter.dev provides a bit
      more insight about the user's device, country, traffic source, etc while
      still having the same privacy features.
      </p> <p>
      honestly love both of them and i've used pirate px for
      <a href="https://adithya.zip" target="_blank">adithya.zip</a> for a long
      time as then i would only need to see a count of the people visiting the
      website and didnt need any unneeded info such as the devices, country,
      sources, etc of the visitors. however now i use counter.dev for this since
      adding the blog so that i can see from where people find my webpage from
      so that i can try to increase traffic. for my other products however,
      <a href="https://moment.adithya.zip" target="_blank">moment</a>,
      <a href="https://neutral.adithya.zip" target="_blank">neutral</a> and
      <a href="https://newtab.adithya.zip" target="_blank">newtab</a>, i have
      always used counter.dev, as i need a bit more insight on where my users
      are coming from and how they access the website / product. honestly these
      two are the best tools to use if you dont want to use google analytics or
      dont want to pay for
      <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="">plausible</a> analytics.
